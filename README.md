# Dynamic Event Calendar App

A dynamic calendar application built using React. This app allows users to view their calendar in month, week, and day formats, add/edit/delete events, and manage event details such as name, time, description, and type. The events are saved in the browser's localStorage for persistence.

## Features

- **Calendar View**: Displays a grid for the current month with aligned days. Navigate between months using "Previous" and "Next" buttons.
- **View Modes**: Switch between month, week, and day views to manage events.
- **Event Management**: Add, edit, and delete events with specific details (name, time, description, and type).
- **Event Type Color Coding**: Events are color-coded based on type (Work, Personal, Others).
- **Event List**: Lists all events for the selected day in a modal or side panel.
- **Persistent Storage**: Events are saved in localStorage to persist even after refreshing the page.
- **Responsive UI**: The app is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
- **UI Design**: Developed using **shadcn** components for a clean and modern look. Highlights the current day and the selected day.
- **Complex Logic**:
  - Handles month transitions (e.g., from January to February).
  - Prevents overlapping events by validating time slots.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js** for building the user interface.
- **date-fns** for handling date manipulations and formatting.
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling the application.
